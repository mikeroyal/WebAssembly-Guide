  WebAssembly Guide
</h1>

#### A guide covering WebAssembly including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient developer with WebAssembly.

## Resources

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) is a new open standard of code that can be run in modern web browsers. It is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. WebAssemly is developed by W3C, Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.

## Tools

[Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) is a Universal Windows Platform Bridge that allows UWP-based code (C# and XAML) to run on iOS, Android, macOS, WebAssembly, Linux and Windows. It provides the full definitions of the UWP [Windows 10 2004 (19041)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/whats-new/windows-10-build-19041), and the implementation of a growing number of parts of the UWP API, such as Windows.UI.Xaml, to enable UWP and WinUI applications to run on these platforms.

[WebAssembly Studio](https://webassembly.studio/) is a tool that allows you to Learn, Teach, Work and Play with WebAssembly.

[WABT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) is a suite of tools for WebAssembly.

[Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly, written in C++. It aims to make [compiling to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Compiling-to-WebAssembly-with-Binaryen) easy, fast, and effective.

[Lucet](https://github.com/alexcrichton/lucet) is a native WebAssembly compiler and runtime. It is designed to safely execute untrusted WebAssembly programs inside your application.

[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) is a feature of ASP.NET, a popular web development framework that extends the.NET developer platform with tools and libraries for building web apps. Run on WebAssembly or the server Blazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using WebAssembly.

[Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/) enables super lightweight containers based on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) that can run anywhere such as the Desktop to the Cloud and IoT devices, and also embedded in [any programming language](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer#language-integrations).

[AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiles a strict variant of TypeScript (JavaScript with types) to WebAssembly using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). 

[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) is a Go compiler(based on LLVM) intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (Wasm), and command-line tools.

[Capstone](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone) is a  disassembly/disassembler framework: Core (Arm, Arm64, BPF, EVM, M68K, M680X, MOS65xx, Mips, PPC, RISCV, Sparc, SystemZ, TMS320C64x, Web Assembly, X86, X86_64, XCore) + bindings.

[Vecty](https://github.com/hexops/vecty) is a tool that lets you build responsive and dynamic web frontends in Go using WebAssembly, competing with modern web frameworks like React & VueJS.

[WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime) is a standalone WebAssembly (WASM) runtime with a small footprint.

[Pion WebRTC](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) is a pure Go implementation of [WebRTC API](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/).

[vim.wasm](http://rhysd.github.io/vim.wasm) is a port of the Vim ediotr to Webassemly using  [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) and [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen).
